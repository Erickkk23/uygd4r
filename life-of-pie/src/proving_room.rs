//! # Proving Room Module
//!
//! This module implements a specialized room for proving dough, a critical step in pizza-making
//! where the dough rises and develops its texture. The proving room demonstrates several important
//! async programming concepts:
//!
//! - Resource limitations with fixed-capacity trays
//! - Long-running operations with `sleep`
//! - Safe state transitions with proper validation
//! - Shared mutable state protected by synchronization primitives
//! - Asynchronous communication using oneshot channels
//!
//! In a real kitchen, proving dough takes significant time and requires dedicated space.
//! This process is modeled asynchronously to simulate the waiting time without blocking
//! other kitchen operations.

/// # Proving Room
///
/// A specialized area in the kitchen where dough is placed to rise (prove).
///
/// The proving room contains multiple trays, each capable of holding one piece of dough.
/// The proving process transforms fermented dough into proved dough, which is necessary
/// before shaping into a pizza base.
///
/// This structure demonstrates resource management in async programming:
/// - Fixed number of trays (limited resource)
/// - Process that takes time but doesn't require active attention
/// - Asynchronous communication using oneshot channels
pub struct ProvingRoom {
    /// Semaphore limiting the number of chefs who can prove dough simultaneously.
    /// We use Arc<Semaphore> so we can clone and share it across async tasks
    trays: Arc<Semaphore>,
}

impl ProvingRoom {
    /// Creates a new proving room with the specified number of trays.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    /// * `num_trays` - The number of proving trays available
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// A new `ProvingRoom` with the specified number of trays
    pub fn new(num_trays: usize) -> Self {

    }

    /// # Asynchronous Proving Process
    ///
    /// Starts the asynchronous proving process for dough, demonstrating several
    /// critical concurrency patterns in a single operation.
    ///
    /// ## Key Concurrency Concepts Demonstrated:
    /// * **Resource acquisition with semaphores**: Uses permits to control access to limited resources
    /// * **Asynchronous waiting**: Waits for a tray without blocking the thread
    /// * **Task spawning**: Creates a background task that runs independently
    /// * **Channel-based communication**: Uses oneshot channels to communicate completion
    /// * **RAII-based cleanup**: Automatically releases resources when the task completes
    ///
    /// ## Implementation Details:
    /// 1. Validates input state (dough must be fermented)
    /// 2. Creates a channel for returning the result
    /// 3. Acquires a semaphore permit (waits if no trays are available)
    /// 4. Spawns a background task to handle the proving process
    /// 5. The background task simulates proving time with sleep
    /// 6. When complete, sends the proved dough through the channel
    /// 7. Automatically releases the permit using Rust's drop system
    ///
    /// ## Educational Notes:
    /// This method demonstrates how Rust's ownership system and RAII principles
    /// work together with asynchronous code. The semaphore permit is automatically
    /// released when it goes out of scope (when the task completes), showing how
    /// Rust helps prevent resource leaks even in complex async scenarios.
    ///

    /// * `dough` - The dough to prove, must be in the Fermented state
