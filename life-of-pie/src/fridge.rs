//! # Fridge Module
//!
//! This module implements the kitchen's refrigerator, which stores ingredients and manages
//! the asynchronous dough fermentation process. The fridge demonstrates several important
//! async programming concepts:
//!
//! - Resource management (ingredients are stored and retrieved)
//! - Long-running background tasks (fermentation process)
//! - One-shot channels for communicating between tasks
//! - Async task spawning for concurrent operations
//!
//! The fridge is protected by a mutex in the Kitchen to prevent race conditions during
//! concurrent access by multiple chefs.

/// # Fridge
///
/// Represents a refrigerator that stores ingredients and manages dough fermentation.
///
/// The fridge maintains inventories of basic ingredients (flour, tomatoes, cheese) and
/// provides methods to retrieve them. It also manages the dough fermentation process,
/// which runs asynchronously in the background.
///
/// In a real kitchen, dough fermentation is a time-consuming process that can run for
/// many hours. This is simulated using asynchronous tasks that run independently and
/// notify completion via channels.
///
/// # Examples
